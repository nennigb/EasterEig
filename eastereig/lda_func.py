""" Define the functions to compute the successive derivatives of the function of the eigenvalue
with respect to nu. These functions appear in
L=K_0 * None + K_1*Lda(nu) + K_2 * Lda2(nu) + ... + K_n * f_n(lda(nu))

  - These functions sould have the same interface : my_fun(k,n,dlda)
  - **If k==n, the terms containing lda^(n) are skipped**. They dont belong to the RHS computation
  - a companion function providing the derivitive with respect to lda should be also defined and
  enrolled in `dlda_flda` dict (at the end) define a dict to get the derivative % lda of the
  function of lda

Remarks:
--------
1. Only linear and quadratic dependancy are now implemented
2. If function are added, don't forget do update `_dlda_flda`
